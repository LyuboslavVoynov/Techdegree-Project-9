Create a Gallery App with React


In this project, you'll build an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. After creating the project with create-react-app, you will build the gallery components, add to the supplied CSS and set up routing.

(Recommended) Use the flickr.photos.search endpoint/method
Display at least 3 links that return a list of photos matching some criteria. For example: Dogs, Cats and Coffee.
Include a "Search" link that includes a search field to let users search for photos.
Use React Router to set up routes for each navigation link in the directory app.
You can use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API.
You should do all data fetching from a container component that passes the data down to presentational components responsible for displaying images


Get a Flickr API key
Create yahoo account/use tumblr account to sign in.
Apply for non-commercial API key https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/.
Youâ€™ll need to set up a config.js file in your project that imports your API key into your application so that you and other users can request data from the Flickr API.
